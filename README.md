# My personal website
### What is this?
This is my personal website (located [here](brandonybutler.github.io "Reference to the website")) which displays my personality, contact methods and various other different projects that I've made, I'm currently working on or where I have been involved during the creation.
### Browser compatibility
I try to make various attempts to ensure browser compatibility on as many platforms as possible, however I can not assure the accuracy of my measures. I have tested the website in the following browsers and confirmed that it behaves as intended:
* Microsoft Edge version 44
* Windows Internet Explorer 11
* Google Chrome version 73
* Mozilla Firefox version 66
* Opera version 58
* Apple Safari version 12
* Tor Browser version 8

However, attempts have been made to create compatibility with Windows Internet Explorer 8 through CSS styling rules and the use of an open-source JavaScript project known as [HTML5Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv "Reference to the HTML5Shiv GitHub repository") that aims at enabling the use of new HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer versions. I did not create it, so all credit goes to the respective project author.
